# Timer


A simple timer to keep on practising with JS functions, jQuery and Bootstrap. The goal of this project is to understand clearly the separation of concerns while working with JS functions, as well as the use of local and global variables. You can find the deployed app [here](https://artemis-p.github.io/JS-Timer/).
